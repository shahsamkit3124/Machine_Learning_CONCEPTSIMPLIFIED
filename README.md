## ML Internship Tasks
### Task#1 MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION
The movie genre classification model employs TF-IDF text representation and Logistic Regression for predicting movie genres based on descriptions. TF-IDF captures term importance, while Logistic Regression learns genre patterns. The model's accuracy is assessed using a test dataset, enabling accurate genre prediction for new movie descriptions.

### Task#2 CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
The Credit Card Fraud Detection model utilizes a Random Forest classifier trained on the `fraudTrain.csv` dataset. The model preprocesses features, including transaction details and categorical data, to predict the likelihood of fraud. The achieved accuracy on the validation set was measured at Validation Accuracy, and the model's performance on the `fraudTest.csv` dataset resulted in a Test Accuracy. The model aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions based on patterns within legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

### Task#3 CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION
The Customer Churn Prediction model is developed using machine learning techniques to forecast the likelihood of customers leaving a subscription-based service or business. Leveraging historical customer data encompassing usage behavior and demographics, the model employs optimized versions of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting algorithms. Through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, the model enhances accuracy and performance in identifying potential churners, aiding businesses in proactive retention strategies.


### Task#4 SPAM SMS DETECTION
The SPAM SMS Detection model is built using machine learning techniques in Python. It utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert SMS message texts into numerical features and then trains three classifiers - Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine. These classifiers learn from a labeled dataset to distinguish between spam and legitimate messages. The model's accuracy and classification reports demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying spam messages by analyzing text content and making predictions based on learned patterns.
